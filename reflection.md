## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Now that I've completed the assignment, I relearned how to properly iterate through lists and dictionaries through understanding the layout of each list and dictionary, how to open a file via "with open as ", and append to a list. Appending to come to me naturally in 256 but through some GeeksForGeeks, I understand that it just adds another entry. This was all refreshing the memory from 256. One thing that did confuse me was iterating through the list of dictionaries and trying to call the specific values in those dictionaries. I ultimately figured it out through nested for loops but the one thing that is still confusing me is the for loops with two variables that are like "for i, string in list." I was able to figure out that it would work for my situation but I'm still confused on what it's actually doing. It's a blur to me on how it properly works, step by step. I ultimately struggled on parsing the strings for the parse_packaging function. I was able to figure it out through a method of detecting the backslashes and the end of the list but it did take me a little while. It's different from what you did and mine isn't running through the checker properly even though it works fine. I don't want to mindlessly copy and paste yours into my code because I would like to develop upon what I have but I just don't know where the issue is. Overall, the place I need more practice is writing those functions to parse strings. My method won't work for all kinds of strings. I was only able to make mine because I knew the format of the entries in the dataset. That might be the reason it's not going through the checker.
